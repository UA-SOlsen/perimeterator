''' A Lambda (AWS) wrapper for Perimeterator fetch.

This wrapper is intended to allow for simplified AWS based deployment of the
Perimeterator fetch component. This allows for a cost effective method of
execution, as the Perimeterator fetch component only needs to execute on a
defined schedule in order to detect changes.
